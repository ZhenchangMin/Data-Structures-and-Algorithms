# Lec4: Divide and Conquer
## The Divide-and-Conquer Approach
- Divide the given problem into a number of **subproblems** that are smaller instances of the same problem.
- Conquer the subproblems by solving them **recursively**.
- Use brute-force to solve one subproblem if it is small enough.
- Combine the solutions of subproblems to obtain the solution for the original one.

Use (strong) mathematical induction to prove the correctness of the approach.
